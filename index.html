            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated with computers. I did a high school internship with the
                schoolâ€™s IT department. I later found a company that specialized in refurbishing technology of all
                form-factors, and in recycling equipment as well. I worked on software, but mostly on the hardware aspect of
                these form-factors. I worked there for three and a half years and my interest in the software and coding area
                grew! I now am fully investing in furthering my education at Lambda School, and to learn everything I can about
                programming! From the front-end to the back-end, from HTML to React, I am ready to launch myself into this
                career-oriented program to become a Full Stack Developer!</p>
